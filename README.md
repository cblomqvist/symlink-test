# symlink-test

Test repo for git symlinks in Windows 10

The file `setup.bat` generates all but the `README.md` and the `LICENSE` file in this repo.

A commit has been made after that script was run.

## Prereqs

Before cloning this repo make sure to:

* Enable developer mode in Windows 10
* Enable symlinks in Git: `git config --global core.symlinks true`
